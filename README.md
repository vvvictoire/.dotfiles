# .trucy_config

Personnal configuration files.

## Why .trucy_config instead of .config?

So I just have to `git clone git@github.com:MagicTrucy/.trucy_config.git` on my new machine.

## How to install?

Execute install.sh.

## What's the `config` file?

It's an i3 config file. Report to the man i3 to know where to put it.
